# homebrew-cask-fonts

Here you'll find font Casks for the [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask)
project.

# Current Status

Fonts installed via `homebrew-cask` are not being recognized at the moment due to a glitch.
A [fix](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask/pull/2258) has been merged and will be in the next release of `homebrew-cask`.

# Usage

After you install `homebrew-cask`, run the following command:

```sh
$ brew tap caskroom/fonts
```

You can now install font Casks.

```sh
$ brew cask install font-source-code-pro
```
