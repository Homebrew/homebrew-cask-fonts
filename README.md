## Font Licenses

homebrew-cask-fonts will only accept fonts which are freely-distributable. However, even freely-distributable fonts may have limitations (for instance, if you use them in a commercial enterprise). It is the responsibility of the user to know and respect the license of each font.

## Installation behind a proxy

Some font Casks use [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/), which requires [configuration when behind a proxy](https://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#proxy).
