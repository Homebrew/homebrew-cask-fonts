# Caskroom-fonts

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caskroom/homebrew-fonts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caskroom/homebrew-fonts)

Caskroom-fonts is a Homebrew Tap which allows you to use the same friendly Homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of binary font files on your Mac.

Here is where you can find or submit font Casks for the [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) project.

## Prerequisites

Fonts are available through homebrew-cask, which is an “external command” of Homebrew. So, first you must install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and [homebrew-cask](https://caskroom.github.io).

## Let’s try it!

```bash
$ brew tap caskroom/fonts                  # you only have to do this once!
$ brew cask install font-inconsolata
```

## Questions? Wanna chat?

We’re really rather friendly! Here are the best places to talk about the project:

* Start an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts/issues)
* Join us on IRC -- we hang out with the Caskroom crowd at `#homebrew-cask` on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/)

## Bugs

### Reporting Bugs

We still have bugs -- and we are busy fixing them! If you have a problem, don’t be shy about reporting it on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-fonts/issues?state=open).

When reporting bugs, remember that the [Caskroom family](https://caskroom.github.io) is an independent project from [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). Do your best to direct bug reports to the appropriate project. If your command-line started with `brew cask`, bring the bug to the Caskroom family first!

## Font Licenses

Caskroom-fonts will only accept fonts which are freely-distributable. However, even freely-distributable fonts may have limitations (for instance, if you use them in a commercial enterprise). It is the responsibility of the user to know and respect the license of each font.

## Caskroom-fonts License
